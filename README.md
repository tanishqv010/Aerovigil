## I. Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a surveillance system using a custom-built drone equipped with advanced sensors. The system aims to monitor vegetation-rich areas, particularly forests, to detect potential forest fires at an early stage. The key focus is on providing a reliable and efficient solution for early warning and intervention, ultimately minimising the damage caused by forest fires.

## II. Features
1. **Sensor Integration**:
- Integrate high-resolution cameras for visual monitoring of vegetation and potential fire sources.
- Integrate temperature and humidity sensor(s) for detecting heat anomalies associated with fire.
- Integrate gas sensors to identify early signs of smoke or combustible gases.

2. **Real-time Data Transmission**:
- Establish a reliable communication system for real-time data transmission from the drone to the ground station.
- Implement a secure and efficient data transfer protocol for transmitting surveillance data.

3. **Fire Prediction and Detection**:
- Implement a machine learning-based fire prediction algorithm using historical data and environmental factors.
- Integrate predictive models to assess the likelihood of fire outbreaks based on current conditions.

4. **Emergency Response System**:
- Integrate an alert system to notify relevant authorities in the event of a detected forest fire.
- Include GPS coordinates in the alert to facilitate a rapid response.

## III. Execution
1. **Design and Prototyping**:
- Design the drone frame and structure to accommodate all necessary components.
- Complete all the processes of calibration anf flight testing.

2. **Sensor Integration**:
- Integrate temparature and humidity sensors, and gas sensors onto the drone platform.
- Calibrate and test each sensor for optimal performance in a forest environment.

3. **Fire Prediction and Detection Implementation**:
- Develop and train machine learning models for fire prediction using historical data and environmental factors.
- Integrate the predictive models with the drone's onboard systems for real-time fire prediction.

4. **System Integration**:
- Integrate all subsystems, including flight system, sensors, fire prediction, and detection, into a cohesive and unified system.
- Ensure seamless communication and interoperability between different components.

## IV. Circuit
The following image shows the circuit diagram of the sensor based circuit used to gather the enviornmental data to predict the forest fires.

## V. Data Sources
We made some alterations in the dataset of burned area of forest fires, in the East Portugal region, available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
<br/>Link - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/162/forest+fires
<br/>Altered dataset comprises of the following Independent factors:
- Temperature (in degree Celsius)
- Relative Humidity (on a scale of 1 to 100)
- Wind Speed (int m/s)
- Rain (1 or 0, i.e., Yes or No)
And we are predicting the Categorical Variable
- Forest Fire (1 or 0)

## VI. Model
On the above given dataset, we trained a Random Forest Classifier and fine-tuned it using Bayesian Optimization Technique and achieved an accuracy of 66.35%
